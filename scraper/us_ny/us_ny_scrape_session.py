ScrapeSession

Datastore model for a scraping session. Used by the scraper to discern
ScrapedRecord entities which predate the current session vs. those from
it (which are records that should be skipped).

Fields:
    - start: Date/time this session started
    - end: Date/time when this session finished

"""
ScrapedRecord

Datastore model for a scraped record entry. We use this to track which records
we've already scraped in the session, and save ourselves and DOCCS the extra
network requests of re-scraping.

Fields:
    - record_id: Dept. ID Number, the ID for a record we've scraped
    - created_on: Date/time when this entry was created
